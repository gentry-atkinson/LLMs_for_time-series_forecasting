## Datasets

Several real-world datasets have been used in this work. Links to each are
available below.Synthetic data has also been used. Using synthetic data will 
let us address the issue of wheter LLMs have "memorized" time-series datasets 
that appear in their training data, or are actually able to forecast the series.

 - Set 1
 - Set 2
